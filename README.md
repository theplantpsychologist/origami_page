# Origami page

This is my page that I use to host my origami projects. 

With regards to the gallery of origami models, the website builds itself so to speak. To add a new model, I simply drop the photo and/or cp into the src folder, and use a short json template to link the files together with a name date and description. Then, compiler.py will compress the photo into a thumbnail, make a copy of a template page, then fill in the template according to the model's json file.
