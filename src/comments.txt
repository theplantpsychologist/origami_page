TODO models (template):
 - reindeer
 - shepherd and sheep
 - everything in 2024
 - add more descriptions to things
 - go through google photos, look for photos and cps that aren't already here and throw them in. easy for models to have multiple photos and cps (once carouseling is set up) (offline task)

 - add "related model" attribute to the json. when compiling, display thumbnail and link to the related piece
 - make tags clickable
    - query strings?
    - or, as part of compile, make a clone of gallery.html for each tag
 - put another "back to gallery" at the bottom of the page. also put a footer

TODO home (index):
 - add hero section
 - add appropriate images for engineering, learn, and business
 - carousel sliding animation
 - add google analytics
 - navbar dropdowns, and change button colors
 - link the source code and add a "last updated: ___" somewhere
 - put copyright or other text in the footer

TODO contact:
 - netlify forms or formspree for built in email services


TODO gallery:
 - set up advanced controls
 - animate the model divs coming in?


TODO before swapping out repos:
 - fix the homepage
 - add at least something to about, learn, engineering, business
 - publish: rename old page, and change this to be the new "origami." 
    - one way to do this: duplicate the other one and save the copy somewhere. Then in the folder that's connected to the other's github repo, delete everything, and dump all the files from this repo into that one. then push
