I would have liked to shape it a bit more, but I managed to turn it in on time and got second place. As expected, I was completely burnt out from origami for a few weeks, but eventually recovered.", "cp": ["fallen angel comparison.png"], "cpdescription": "I didn't draw a full cp for a number of reasons (mainly because it was a lot of work) but I did think it would be worth showing a comparison of the packings to show how much I ended up modifying the model. I reduced the grid size by adding pythagorean stretches, changed the proportions of the arms, rearranged the head and body to add robe details, and added an entire shaped skull where the original model had just an empty hood. <br><br>Grid: 64x64 for original, 60x60 for modified", "video": null, "diagrams": ["", ""], "tags": ["human", "mythical", "bp", "uniaxial", "has_cp", "2021"]}
