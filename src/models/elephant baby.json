    "cpdescription": "This could be considered analagous to tilted grid but with hex pleating. Generally, hex pleating doesn't do so well with diagonal symmetry in a square, because none of the edges will lie on grid points. However, in this case, diagonal symmetry is the most efficient due to the long trunk. <br><br> To fold the grid, divide the diagonal into 18ths.",
