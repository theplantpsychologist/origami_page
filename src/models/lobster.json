    "description": "A few years prior, <a href=\"https://x.com/tuok3110/status/1123586042169159680\">Kota Imai's box pleated design of a japanese spiny lobster</a> gained a lot of attention for the sheer complexity that went into making all the spines and textures of a lobster. It has since become among the ranks of the ryujin 3.5 as one of the top landmarks of complex origami. Thus, since the beginning of my hp journey, it has been a goal of mine to recreate the JSL in hex pleating.",
