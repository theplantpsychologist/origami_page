    "description": "Collaboratively designed and folded with Boice Wong and Chris Conrad at the 2022 Origami USA convention. This was perhaps the biggest (or at least, the first) collaboration design of it's kind: 3 figures, designed in 3 separate styles, folded simultaneously by 3 people, all from a single uncut square. <br><br> The design is loosely based off The Lord of the Rings world, featuring a hobbit (mine), human (Boice's), and an elf (Chris's). The name \"The Power of Friendship\" was as a testament to the power of collaboration within the origami community. When we work together, we can create things that are better than any of us could have created individually.",
