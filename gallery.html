            Remember to add a listener to wait for the content of the document to be fully loaded.

            To do here: 
            upon the user input of a "filter" button:
                read the filter inputs
                Go through all the json files in the "models" folder, using the data in model_data.json 
                    If the model satisfies the filters, add it to the queue
                sort the queue if a sort filter was applied: name, date, etc
                display the models from the queue into model_gallery. For each display:
                    load the thumbnail as a link. When hovered, the model name appears
                    when clicked, link to gallery/model.html with the model name as a parameter
