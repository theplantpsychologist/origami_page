    "long_description": "Origami-inspired 3d printed kinetic sculpture prototype, for my TeamLab internship. The models were made by printing a few base layers, inserting a thin net-like fabric, and then printing a few layers on top of that to form polygons of rigid plastic joined by gaps of thin fabric. With a little bit of actuation (either manually like the gif or with motors like the video), the models will buckle and cast reflections like the surface of a body of water. The effect is amplified under strobe lighting (see the gif).",
