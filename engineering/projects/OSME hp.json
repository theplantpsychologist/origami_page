    "long_description": "A summary of my findings with representational hex pleating. Submitted and presented at 8OSME. Essentially, I show how uniaxial hex pleating can be used for greater flexibility, layer distribution, and embedded textures compared to uniaxial box pleating, and then introduce non-uniaxial hex pleating for creating 3d \"representational polyhedra\".",
