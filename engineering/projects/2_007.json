    "long_description": "Final project for 2.007 (Design and Manufacturing I). This class is what high school robotics competitions are based off of, except instead of a team of 20 high schoolers for half a year you're a solo college student for 4 months.<br><br>The robot is tasked with scoring as many points as possible on the game board. The year that I took the class, the game board was based off the <i>Wakanda Forever</i> movie that was partly filmed at MIT. The task my robot completed was to \"assemble the DNA\" by placing red balls onto a rotating elevated plate. See the video demo below--actually placing the balls is very difficult with the rotating helix, but the robot is at least able to reliably lift the balls up to the plate.",
