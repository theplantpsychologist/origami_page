    "long_description": "Made from 3d printed compliant keys and an arduino. When each key is pressed, the copper tapes under the key come into contact, sending a signal to an arduino mega that has a digital input for each key. The arduino then reports which keys are currently being pressed to a python script. The script then pulls from pre-recorded sound files of each note and combines the notes that are being played.<br><br>Sorry the video is so bad, I never properly learned how to play piano--in fact the motivation for making this was so that I could practice on a portable keyboard.",
