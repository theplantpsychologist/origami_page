    <h1 id="name">Japanese Spiny Lobster</h1>
    <p id="date">March 2023</p>
    <p id="description">A few years prior, <a href="https://x.com/tuok3110/status/1123586042169159680">Kota Imai's box pleated design of a japanese spiny lobster</a> gained a lot of attention for the sheer complexity that went into making all the spines and textures of a lobster. It has since become among the ranks of the ryujin 3.5 as one of the top landmarks of complex origami. Thus, since the beginning of my hp journey, it has been a goal of mine to recreate the JSL in hex pleating.</p>

    <p id="cpdescription">This could be described as "multiaxial" hex pleating, or you could call it normal hp with some really complicated level shifters. In any case, it uses a weird layout to create the solid width of the body</p>
